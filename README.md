# Lab-9-Magic-Eight-Ball

Have you ever seen a Magic 8-ball?  You ask it a yes-no question and then shake it to get a random response like “Signs point to yes!”, or “Very doubtful”, etc. 

Come up with 8 responses to yes-no questions.  Write a program that asks the user for a question and then chooses a random respose to give to the user.
Your code should choose a random number from 1 to 8 and then use if statements to test the number and print out the associated random response from 1 – 8.    

Requirements-
-	Header including your name, date, project title and project description must be included.
-	Programming comments should be included for each logical block of code
-	Program should ask the user to enter a yes-no question.
-	After the user enters a question, the program should randomly choose one of 8 responses chosen by using a random number.
-	Output should be easy to read, with no typographical errors.


Possible output:

        Enter a yes/no question that you would like answered by the Magic Eight Ball:
        Should I go to the soccer game today?
        The Magic Eight Ball says:  "Heck, yeah!"
